 A simple dataset representing gene expression levels. 
Gene expression levels are calculated by the ratio between the expression of the target gene (i.e., the gene of interest) and 
the expression of one or more reference genes (often household genes). This dataset is synthetic and 
specifically designed to show some of the strengths and limitations of using KNN for Classification.
