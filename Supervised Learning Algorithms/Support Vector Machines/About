Classification Task----
The data shown here simulates a medical study in which mice infected with a virus were given various doses of two medicines and then checked 2 weeks later to see if they were still infected. Given this data, our goal is to create a classifcation model than predict (given two dosage measurements) if they mouse will still be infected with the virus.

You will notice the groups are very separable, this is on purpose, to explore how the various parameters of an SVM model behave.




Regression Task----
Our data set consists of various cement properties and the resulting slump test metrics in cm. Later on the set concrete is tested for its compressive strength 28 days later.
Input variables (7)(component kg in one M^3 concrete):

Cement
Slag
Fly ash
Water
SP
Coarse Aggr.
Fine Aggr.
Output variables (3):

SLUMP (cm)
FLOW (cm)
28-day Compressive Strength (Mpa)
